Split rendered reStructuredText into JSON

``rst2json`` renders a reStructuredText_ document as HTML or (Xe)LaTeX, but —
unlike Docutils_' builtin converters, which produce a complete output document
— it outputs a JSON object in which the document "frontmatter" (title,
subtitle, bibliographic fields, etc.) has been broken out from the body and
split into multiple fields.  By combining this output with a templating system
like Jinja_, the user can perform more powerful & more customizable templating
than is possible with Docutils' built-in template support.  Version 0.3.0 even
introduces the ability to split apart documents at section boundaries, thereby
making it possible to convert a single input document into multiple output
files.

Sample templates that make use of the library's output, along with a sample
application for splitting sections into separate files, can be found in
|exampledir|_.
