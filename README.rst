``rst2json`` renders a reStructuredText_ document as HTML or (Xe)LaTeX, but —
unlike Docutils_' builtin converters, which produce a complete output document
— it outputs a JSON object in which the document "frontmatter" (title,
subtitle, bibliographic fields, etc.) has been broken out from the body and
split into multiple fields.  By combining the output with a templating system
like Jinja_, the user can perform more powerful & more customizable templating
than is possible with Docutils' built-in template support.  Version 0.3.0 even
introduces the ability to split apart documents at section boundaries, thereby
making it possible to convert a single input document into multiple output
files.

Sample templates that make use of the library's output, along with a sample
application for splitting sections into separate files, can be found in
|exampledir|_.

Installation
============
``rst2json`` requires Python 3.6 or higher.  Just use `pip
<https://pip.pypa.io>`_ for Python 3 (You have pip, right?) to install
``rst2json`` and its dependencies::

    python3 -m pip install rst2json


Command-Line Usage
==================

``rst2json`` provides a single command, also named ``rst2json``, that converts
an input reStructuredText document to markup organized into a JSON object::

    rst2json [--format <FMT>] [<docutils options>] [<infile> [<outfile>]]

The target markup format is specified with the ``-f`` or ``--format`` option.
Valid values (case insensitive) are:

``html`` (default)
   Alias for ``html4``.  When Docutils eventually changes ``rst2html.py`` to
   produce HTML 5 output instead of HTML 4, this alias will likewise update to
   point to ``html5``.

``html4``
   HTML 4 / XHTML 1.0 output, based on the Docutils writer used for
   ``rst2html4.py``.  A CSS stylesheet (such as the ``html4css1.css``
   stylesheet distributed with Docutils) must be added to the final document in
   order for everything to render properly.

``html5``
   HTML 5 output, based on the Docutils writer used for ``rst2html4.py``.  A
   CSS stylesheet (such as the ``minimal.css`` and ``plain.css`` stylesheets
   distributed with Docutils) must be added to the final document in order for
   everything to render properly.

``latex``
   LaTeX output, based on the Docutils writer used for ``rst2latex.py``

``latex2e``
   Alias for ``latex``

``xetex``
   Alias for ``xelatex``

``xelatex``
   XeLaTeX output, based on the Docutils writer used for ``rst2xetex.py``

In addition to the ``--format`` option, the ``rst2json`` command accepts all
options that Docutils' ``rst2html4.py``, ``rst2html5.py``, ``rst2latex.py``,
and ``rst2xetex.py`` commands accept, and it can also be configured via a
`Docutils configuration file
<https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/user/config.html>`_ the same way as the
respective Docutils commands.  Additional ``rst2json``-specific options are
also accepted; see "`Configuration Options`_" for details.


Library Usage
=============

Convenience Function
--------------------

*New in version 0.2.0*

.. code:: python

    rst2json.core.rst2json(source, format='html', options=None, config_files=None, destination_path=None)

``rst2json`` provides a ``rst2json.core.rst2json()`` function for rendering &
splitting reStructuredText into a ``dict`` directly within Python.

``source`` specifies the input reStructuredText markup.  It can be a path to a
file (a string), a file-like object (with ``read()`` and ``close()`` methods),
or a path-like object.

``format`` is a string specifying the markup format to produce.  It has the
same set of possible values as the ``--format`` option to the ``rst2json``
command.  Alternatively, it may be set directly to an instance of a Docutils
writer class.

``options`` sets values for Docutils settings.  When non-``None``, it must be a
``dict`` that maps option names to option values.  Option names must be given
as listed at <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/user/config.html>, i.e., no
leading hyphens, with internal hyphens replaced with underscores.  Option
values must be of the appropriate Python type, e.g., ``bool`` for on/off
switches or ``List[str]`` for comma-separated values.  Both standard Docutils
options and the ``rst2json``-specific options listed under "`Configuration
Options`_" are accepted.

``config_files`` is a list of file paths specifying the Docutils configuration
files to read from; if ``None``, configuration is read from the files specified
in the ``DOCUTILSCONFIG`` environment variable, or from the standard
configuration files if that is not set.  Settings in configuration files
override any conflicting settings given in ``options``.

``destination_path`` is a path to a file (which need not exist) which
stylesheet paths in HTML ``<link>`` tags will be rewritten relative to; if
``None``, the paths are rewritten relative to the current directory.  This
parameter is only relevant when emitting HTML with ``math_output`` set to
``html`` with a stylesheet argument.

.. Will also be relevant if stylesheet_path links are ever captured


Docutils Writers
----------------

The actual rendering & conversion to JSON is done by custom Writer classes
inheriting from Docutils' built-in Writers.  Users familiar with Docutils can
use these Writers directly in combination with other Docutils machinery.

The ``rst2json.writers.get_json_writer_class()`` function can be used to
retrieve a specific Writer class by case-insensitive name.  The classes and
their names are as follows:

======================  ===================================
Names                   Class
======================  ===================================
``html``, ``html4``     ``rst2json.writers.html4.Writer``
``html5``               ``rst2json.writers.html5.Writer``
``latex``, ``latex2e``  ``rst2json.writers.latex.Writer``
``xelatex``, ``xetex``  ``rst2json.writers.xelatex.Writer``
======================  ===================================

Each Writer's ``translate()`` method sets ``writer.json_data`` to the final
JSON structure as a ``dict`` and sets ``writer.output`` to ``json_data`` as a
JSON-serialized string.  After ``assemble_parts()`` is then called,
``writer.parts["json_data"]`` will also equal the JSON ``dict``.


Configuration Options
=====================

New Options
-----------

In addition to the standard Docutils options, ``rst2json`` accepts the
following options, both via configuration files and (for the command) via the
command line.  When setting these options via a configuration file, they should
be placed in an ``[rst2json]`` section.

``split_section_level``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*New in version 0.3.0*

Set this option to an integer value.  Setting it to a positive number causes
the content body to be split up into an ``"intro"`` field (all content before
the start of the first section) and a ``"sections"`` field (each section
represented as an object).  The sections' subsections are split up as well, up
to a depth given by the value of ``split_section_level``.  Setting this option
to zero disables section splitting; setting it to a negative number causes all
sections at all depths to be split up.

As an example, consider the following document:

.. code:: restructuredtext

    Text before sections, except after C.

    Section 1
    =========

    .. _foo:

    Lorem ipsum yadda yadda yadda.

    Section 2
    =========

    'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe.

    Section 2.1
    -----------

    .. _bar:

    All mimsy were the borogoves, and the mome raths outgrabe.

    Section 2.1.1
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Beware the Jabberwock, my son!

Processing this document with ``split_section_level`` set to 1 will produce a
JSON document in which the ``content`` object's ``body`` field is replaced with
the following fields (Some fields have been omitted for brevity):

.. code:: json

    {
        "intro": "<p>Text before sections, except after C.</p>",
        "sections": [
            {
                "title": "Section 1",
                "ids": ["section-1"],
                "depth": 1,
                "body": "<p id=\"foo\">Lorem ipsum yadda yadda yadda.</p>\n"
            },
            {
                "title": "Section 2",
                "ids": ["section-2"],
                "depth": 1,
                "body": "<p>'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe.</p>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"section-2-1\">\n<h2>Section 2.1</h2>\n<p id=\"bar\">All mimsy were the borogoves, and the mome raths outgrabe.</p>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"section-2-1-1\">\n<h3>Section 2.1.1</h3>\n<p>Beware the Jabberwock, my son!</p>\n</div>\n</div>"
            }
        ]
    }

Processing with the option set to 2 causes all top-level sections' bodies to be
split up into ``"intro"`` and ``"sections"`` like so:

.. code:: json

    {
        "intro": "<p>Text before sections, except after C.</p>",
        "sections": [
            {
                "title": "Section 1",
                "ids": ["section-1"],
                "depth": 1,
                "intro": "<p id=\"foo\">Lorem ipsum yadda yadda yadda.</p>",
                "sections": []
            },
            {
                "title": "Section 2",
                "ids": ["section-2"],
                "depth": 1,
                "intro": "<p>'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe.</p>",
                "sections": [
                    {
                        "title": "Section 2.1",
                        "ids": ["section-2-1"],
                        "depth": 2,
                        "body": "<p id=\"bar\">All mimsy were the borogoves, and the mome raths outgrabe.</p>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"section-2-1-1\">\n<h3>Section 2.1.1</h3>\n<p>Beware the Jabberwock, my son!</p>\n</div>"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }

Setting the option to 3 will in turn cause the "Section 2.1" object to also be
split up, and so forth.

Default: 0.  Command line option: ``--split-section-level``


Ignored Options
---------------

``rst2json`` ignores the following Docutils configuration options, as they have
no effect on its operation:

- ``documentclass``
- ``documentoptions``
- ``latex_preamble``
- ``stylesheet_path``
- ``stylesheet``
- ``template``
- ``use_latex_abstract``
- ``use_latex_docinfo``

In addition, the ``embed_stylesheet`` and ``stylesheet_dirs`` options only have
an effect when emitting HTML with ``math_output`` set to ``html`` with a
stylesheet argument.


JSON Output Structure
=====================

The below description divides strings into the following types:

- A *rendered string* is a string containing markup in the target format (HTML
  or LaTeX).  Rendered strings are stripped of leading & trailing newlines.

- A *stripped string* is a string in which characters with special meaning to
  the format are escaped but all other markup has been removed; in addition,
  in stripped strings with corresponding rendered strings, newlines and tabs
  are replaced with space characters.

  For example, under HTML, if ``content.title`` is ``"<i>War &amp;
  Peace</i>"``, then ``content.title_stripped`` would be ``"War &amp; Peace"``.

- Unqualified (neither rendered nor stripped) strings are expected to never
  contain any special characters.

----

The output from ``rst2json`` is a JSON object containing the following fields:

``content`` : object
   The input document converted to the target format and broken up into the
   following fields:

   ``title`` : rendered string or ``null``
      The document title, derived from a lone top-level section title if
      |doctitle_xform|_ is enabled, or ``null`` if no title was specified or
      ``doctitle_xform`` was not enabled.

   ``subtitle`` : rendered string or ``null``
      The document subtitle, derived from a lone second-level section title
      after the document title if |doctitle_xform|_ is enabled, or ``null`` if
      no subtitle was specified or ``doctitle_xform`` was not enabled.

   ``title_stripped`` : stripped string or ``null``
      The ``title`` field, but with non-escaping markup removed.  This field
      can be used to populate an HTML document's ``<title>`` tag.

   ``subtitle_stripped`` : stripped string or ``null``
      The ``subtitle`` field, but with non-escaping markup removed.  This field
      can be used to populate an HTML document's ``<title>`` tag.

   ``document_ids`` : list of strings
      A list of all IDs assigned to the parsed ``document`` node.  Such IDs
      should be attached to the topmost or near-topmost structure of the final
      templated document using HTML's ``id`` attribute or (Xe)LaTeX's
      ``\label`` command.

   ``document_classes`` : list of strings
      A list of classes attached to the parsed ``document`` node.

   ``subtitle_ids`` : list of strings
      A list of all IDs assigned to the document subtitle, or the empty list if
      the document does not have a subtitle.  Such IDs should be attached to
      the templated subtitle using HTML's ``id`` attribute or (Xe)LaTeX's
      ``\label`` command.

   ``subtitle_classes`` : list of strings
      A list of classes attached to the document subtitle, or the empty list if
      the document does not have a subtitle.

   ``authors`` : list of rendered strings
      A list of all authors specified in the ``:Author:`` and/or ``:Authors:``
      `bibliographic fields`_, in the order that they appear in the input.

   ``header`` : rendered string or ``null``
      The rendered contents of the ``header::`` directive from the document, or
      ``null`` if there was no such directive.  Markup for using it as a header
      is not included.

   ``footer`` : rendered string or ``null``
      The rendered contents of the ``footer::`` directive from the document, or
      ``null`` if there was no such directive.  Markup for using it as a footer
      is not included.

   ``docinfo`` : list of objects
      The document's `bibliographic fields`_ (excluding the dedication &
      abstract) in the order that they appear in the input, each one
      represented as an object with the following fields:

      ``type`` : string
         For registered fields, this is the name of the Docutils node class
         that represents the field — i.e., the English name of the field in
         lowercase (e.g., ``"author"``).  For unregistered fields, this is the
         string ``"field"``.

      ``name`` : rendered string
         For registered fields, this is the name of the field in the document's
         language (e.g., ``"Author"``).  For unregistered fields, this is the
         name of the field as it appears in the input.

      ``value``
         When ``type`` is ``"authors"`` (plural), this is a list of author
         names as rendered strings.  For all other values of ``type``, this is
         a rendered string.

         Note that, when ``type`` is ``"address"``, whitespace in ``value`` is
         significant, and ``value`` should be wrapped in ``<pre>`` tags or
         similar.

      ``value_stripped``
         The ``value`` field, but with non-escaping markup removed.  When
         ``type`` is ``"authors"`` (plural), this is a list of stripped
         strings.  For all other values of ``type``, this is a stripped string.
         This field can be used to populate the ``content`` attribute of a
         ``<meta>`` tag.

      ``classes`` : list of strings
         A list of classes attached to the field.  Normally, for registered
         fields, this list is empty, while for unregistered fields it contains
         a single element equal to the field name converted to a valid class
         token.  This field can be used to set the CSS class of the HTML
         structure that contains the rendered field.

   ``abstract`` : rendered string or ``null``
      The rendered contents of the document's ``:Abstract:`` field, or ``null``
      if there was no such field.  The abstract title and enclosing block are
      not included.

   ``dedication`` : rendered string or ``null``
      The rendered contents of the document's ``:Dedication:`` field, or
      ``null`` if there was no such field.  The dedication title and enclosing
      block are not included.

   ``body`` : rendered string
      The rendered contents of the rest of the document after the frontmatter.
      This field is only present if ``split_section_level`` (See
      "`Configuration Options`_") is 0.

   ``intro`` : rendered string
      The rendered content after the frontmatter, but before the first section.
      This field is only present if ``split_section_level`` is not 0.

   ``sections`` : list of objects
      A list of the top-level sections of the document, each one represented as
      an object with the below fields.  This field is only present if
      ``split_section_level`` is not 0.

      ``title`` : rendered string
         The section title

      ``subtitle`` : rendered string or ``null``
         The section subtitle, derived from a lone second-level title after the
         section title if |sectsubtitle_xform|_ is enabled, or ``null`` if no
         subtitle was specified or ``sectsubtitle_xform`` was not enabled.

      ``title_stripped`` : stripped string
         The ``title`` field, but with non-escaping markup removed

      ``subtitle_stripped`` : stripped string or ``null``
         The ``subtitle`` field, but with non-escaping markup removed

      ``ids`` : list of strings
         A list of all IDs assigned to the parsed ``section`` node.

      ``classes`` : list of strings
         A list of classes attached to the parsed ``section`` node.

      ``subtitle_ids`` : list of strings
         A list of all IDs assigned to the section subtitle, or the empty list
         if the section does not have a subtitle.

      ``subtitle_classes`` : list of strings
         A list of classes attached to the section subtitle, or the empty list
         if the section does not have a subtitle.

      ``toc_backref`` : string or ``null``
         If this section is listed in a table of contents with backlinks, this
         field will equal the ID of the location in the table of contents that
         the backlink should point to; otherwise, it will be ``null``.  If the
         section is listed in more than one table of contents with backlinks,
         which value ends up in this field is Docutils-implementation-defined.

      ``number`` : stripped string or ``null``
         The section number as generated by the ``sectnum::`` directive, or
         ``null`` if no section number was generated for the section.

      ``depth`` : integer
         The depth of the section: 1 for a top-level section, 2 for a
         subsection, 3 for a sub-subsection, etc.

      ``body`` : rendered string
         The rendered contents of the section.  This field is only present if
         ``split_section_level`` is equal to the section depth.

      ``intro`` : rendered string
         The rendered content of the section before the first subsection.  This
         field is only present if ``split_section_level`` is negative or
         greater than the section depth.

      ``sections`` : list of objects
         A list of the top-level subsections of this section, each one
         represented as an object with the same schema as
         ``content.sections[]``.  This field is only present if
         ``split_section_level`` is negative or greater than the section depth.

      ``trailing_transition`` : object or ``null``
         If there is a transition between this section and the next one, this
         field will be an object with the fields ``ids`` (a list of IDs
         assigned to the transition) and ``classes`` (a list of classes
         assigned to the transition); otherwise, this field will be ``null``.
         Note that, in a parsed document tree, inter-section transitions only
         ever occur between consecutive sections of the same depth.

   **Note**: As far as the author of this library can determine, it is not
   possible for a reStructuredText document to produce a doctree in which the
   document title, docinfo, header, footer, abstract, dedication, or section
   title nodes have any IDs or classes, nor for any docinfo field nodes to have
   any IDs.  ``rst2json`` thus does not output any fields for such values.

``meta`` : object
   A dictionary of data about the input document and the ``rst2json`` process,
   containing the following fields:

   ``format`` : string
      The name of the target markup format: ``"html4"``, ``"html5"``,
      ``"latex"``, or ``"xelatex"``.

   ``split_section_level`` : integer
      The value set for the ``split_section_level`` option (See
      "`Configuration Options`_").  Negative values are converted to -1.

   ``title`` : stripped string or ``null``
      The document's metadata title.  By default, this is equal to
      ``content.title_stripped``, but it can be overridden by a ``title::``
      directive or the ``title`` configuration option.  If none of these are
      set, the field is ``null``.

      Note that, if the title is set via the ``title::`` directive or ``title``
      configuration option, any reStructuredText markup in it will not be
      processed (though characters special to the output format will still be
      escaped).  For example, including ``.. title:: *War & Peace*`` in your
      input document will (when outputting HTML) produce a ``meta.title`` value
      of ``"*War &amp; Peace*"``, with the asterisks left as-is and the
      ampersand escaped.

   ``source`` : stripped string
      The name of/path to the input file.  If no name can be determined, then
      this will be the string ``"None"`` in Docutils 0.16 and the empty string
      in later versions.

   ``language`` : string
      The language code for the document language, as set via the
      |language_code|_ configuration option

   ``docutils_version`` : string
      The version of Docutils used to produce the output

   ``rst2json_version`` : string
      The version of ``rst2json`` used to produce the output

   ``generator`` : stripped string
      A string of the form ``"rst2json {version} ({url}), Docutils {version}
      ({url})"``

``html`` : object
   A dictionary of strings to insert in the head of the final HTML document.
   This object only appears in the output when the target format is HTML4 or
   HTML5.  The fields of the dictionary are as follows:

   ``math_requires`` : rendered string
      If the input document contains any ``math::`` directives or ``:math:``
      roles, this is a string containing the appropriate markup to add to the
      HTML document head in order to support them; if there are no such
      directives or roles, this is the empty string.

      When set, the value of this field is determined by the |math_output|_
      configuration option.  When set to ``html``, it is either a ``<link>``
      tag or a ``<style>`` block (as determined by the |embed_stylesheet|_
      configuration option) enabling the stylesheet passed as the option
      argument; when set to ``mathjax``, it is a ``<script>`` tag pointing to
      the path or URL passed as the option argument.  When ``math_output`` is
      ``mathml`` or ``latex``, the ``math_requires`` field is the empty string,
      as nothing needs to be added to the HTML document.

   ``meta_tags`` : rendered string
      A string containing any & all ``<meta>`` tags added to the document with
      the ``meta::`` directive.  If no ``meta::`` directives were given, this
      is the empty string.

``latex`` : object
   A dictionary of strings to insert in the preamble of the final (Xe)LaTeX
   document.  This object only appears in the output when the target format is
   LaTeX or XeLaTeX.  The fields of the dictionary are as follows:

   ``language`` : string
      The name of the document language (set via the |language_code|_
      configuration option) in a form recognized by Babel.  If Docutils does
      not recognize the language, this will be the empty string.  Note that,
      when the language is not English, ``latex.requirements`` will already
      contain the appropriate ``\usepackage[LANGUAGE]{babel}`` command; the
      purpose of this field is to be able to set the language in the document
      options.

   ``requirements`` : rendered string
      Required packages and setup, mostly consisting of ``\includepackage``
      commands needed for the markup in ``content.body``.  In a templated
      (Xe)LaTeX document, this should be placed near the beginning of the
      preamble.

   ``fallbacks`` : rendered string
      Fallback definitions (declared with ``\providecommand*``) for the various
      custom commands that Docutils uses in the body.  These definitions can be
      overridden by defining commands of the same name in the preamble before
      ``latex.fallbacks`` occurs.  In a templated (Xe)LaTeX document, this
      should be placed after ``latex.requirements`` and after any custom
      preamble commands.

   ``pdfsetup`` : rendered string
      Inclusion & setup of the ``hyperref`` package.  In a templated (Xe)LaTeX
      document, this should be placed at the end of the preamble.

``system_messages`` : list of objects
   A list of system messages generated during processing of the input document.
   Normally, system messages are embedded in the output in addition to being
   reported to stderr, but ``rst2json`` removes them from the body and places
   them in this list.  Each system message is represented as an object with the
   following fields:

   ``level`` : integer
      The system message level as an integer from 0 (least severe) through 4
      (most severe)

   ``type`` : string
      The name of the system message level.  The names and corresponding
      integer values of the system message levels are as follows:

      ===========  =========
      ``type``     ``level``
      ===========  =========
      ``DEBUG``    0
      ``INFO``     1
      ``WARNING``  2
      ``ERROR``    3
      ``SEVERE``   4
      ===========  =========

   ``source`` : stripped string
      The name of the input file in which the message was generated.  If no
      name can be determined, then this will be the string ``"None"`` in
      Docutils 0.16 and the empty string in later versions.

   ``line`` : integer or ``null``
      The line of the input file at which the message was generated, or
      ``null`` if it cannot be determined

   ``body`` : rendered string
      The message itself

   ``ids`` : list of strings
      The IDs of the ``system_message`` node.  If the parsed document tree
      contains a ``problematic`` node enclosing the markup that generated the
      system message, the rendered ``problematic`` node will link to this
      system message by targeting an ID in ``ids``.

      If the system message is included in the templated document, the IDs
      should be attached to the structure using HTML's ``id`` attribute or
      (Xe)LaTeX's ``\label`` command.

   ``backrefs`` : list of strings
      If the parsed document tree contains a ``problematic`` node enclosing the
      markup that generated the system message, ``backrefs`` will contain the
      rendered ``problematic`` node's IDs, usable for creating an
      intra-document link.

``id_sections`` : object
   This object only appears in the output when ``split_section_level`` (See
   "`Configuration Options`_") is not 0.  It is a map in which each key is an
   ID appearing in the rendered document body and the corresponding value is
   the first ID of the deepest split-section object in which the key ID occurs.
   IDs of inter-section transitions are mapped to the ID of the section in
   whose ``trailing_transition`` field they are stored.  IDs that appear in
   ``content.intro`` are mapped to the special string ``"$intro"``.  IDs of
   top-level sections are not included as keys in this map, but IDs of deeper
   sections are.

   This field can be used to rewrite inter-document links when the output is
   used to create a separate templated document for each section.

   As an example, consider the following document:

   .. code:: restructuredtext

       Section 1
       =========

       .. _foo:

       Lorem ipsum yadda yadda yadda.

       Section 2
       =========

       'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe.

       Section 2.1
       -----------

       .. _bar:

       All mimsy were the borogoves, and the mome raths outgrabe.

       Section 2.1.1
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

       Beware the Jabberwock, my son!

   If this is processed with a ``split_section_level`` of 1, then
   ``id_sections`` will look like:

   .. code:: json

       {
           "foo": "section-1",
           "section-2-1": "section-2",
           "bar": "section-2",
           "section-2-1-1": "section-2"
       }


   If this is processed with a ``split_section_level`` of 2, then
   ``id_sections`` will look like:

   .. code:: json

       {
           "foo": "section-1",
           "section-2-1": "section-2",
           "bar": "section-2-1",
           "section-2-1-1": "section-2-1"
       }

   Increasing ``split_section_level`` beyond this point or making it negative
   will not have any further effect.
